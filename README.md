# LoanApprovalPred
Loan Approval Prediction using Classification

This model is based on the Supervised Machine Learning Classification Algorithms. In this, the dataset contains several parameters(columns) such as number of dependents,education,self-employment status,loan amount,credit history,etc.
and based on these factors, the model is trained and it predicts whether the applicant should be granted a loan or not. The algorithms used are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost.

The accuracy of the models is compared to get an insight of the performance of the model on the given dataset.
